- Transparent window idea.

- This could be a potential issue - if you call update_window_position() on a maximized window, SetWindowPos may not behave as expected since maximized windows have special positioning behavior in Windows.

- assign gaps to the monitor boundaries as well.

- what to do with maximized windows. maybe do not ignore them.

- negative gap values can be used in configuration
